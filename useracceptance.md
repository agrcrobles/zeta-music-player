User Acceptance Criteria
As a music fan:
● I see a web page with a search bar.
● If I enter a text whether artist, song, album or genre and do enter in
the keyboard I see a list of songs in the same page with:
○ Song title.
○ Artist.
○ Album title.
○ Cover thumbnail.
○ Song length.
○ Gender.
○ Price.
● If I click on song length, genre or price, the list gets sorted by the
field clicked.

where I see a music player with:
○ Information of the selected song:
*  Cover.
*  Song title.
